# Playful Youngster

Original Game Boy emulator written in Rust.

It's a work in progress and it may never see a stable release as I'm developing it for fun.

## Documentation

Talented developers and reverse-engineers already wrote plenty of emulators, but most importantly **documents**. This project wouldn't have been possible without such material. I'm very grateful to those who took time and passion to lay the ground for writing emulators to us non-experts. Writing emulators is difficult, but in the case of the Gameboy, it's _less_ difficult.

Among sparse forum threads and question/answer sessions, these are the resources I used the most:

- Gbdev's [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs).
- Gekkio's [technical reference](https://gekkio.fi/files/gb-docs/gbctr.pdf), especially useful for CPU instructions.
- Lazy Stripe's [blog post series](https://blog.tigris.fr/2019/07/06/writing-an-emulator-its-all-about-the-journey/).

- [rboy](https://github.com/mvdnes/rboy) emulator, as a reference to bootstrap the project.
- [goboy](https://github.com/Humpheh/goboy) emulator, ditto.
